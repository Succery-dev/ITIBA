## Product Vision

#### **Peer-to-Peer Game Account Marketplace using ERC-6551**

Our project aims to build a peer-to-peer marketplace for game accounts using ERC-6551, the Ethereum standard for token-bound accounts (TBAs) tied to ERC-721 NFTs. The platform will allow users to freely list their TBA-linked NFTs for sale and enable other users to purchase these accounts.

## Why create these products?

During the Web2 era, the trading of game accounts was a bustling activity that significantly contributed to the game ecosystem's vibrancy. Users could monetize their invested time and effort, while new players could jumpstart their gaming journey.

However, in the Web3 paradigm, the situation has become much more complicated. In the Web3 landscape, Ethereum-based games typically utilize Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which make the trading of game accounts virtually impossible. The main reason is the need for sharing seed phrases, which would give the new owner access not just to the game account, but also to all other assets and personal information connected to that EOA. This presents a major security risk and privacy concern, effectively making the trading of game accounts impractical and unsafe.
